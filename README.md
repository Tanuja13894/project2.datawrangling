# project2.Data Wrangling & Data Acqusition
project aim:-Data Wrangling & Data Acqusition
Data Wrangling :-Data wrangling is crucial because insights and decisions are only as good as the data they're based on. Clean and well-structured data can lead to valuable insights and guide business decisions.
Data Acqusition:-Data acquisition is the process of sampling signals that measure real-world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a computer. 
Data.isnull:-The isnull() method returns a DataFrame objectwhere all the values are replaced with a Boolean value True for NULL values, and otherwise False.
Missing values:-To detect these missing value, use the isna () or notna () methods. isna () or notna () will also consider None a missing value.
Data Drop:-the Pandas drop () function in Python. DataFrame.drop (labels=None, axis=0, index=None, columns=None, level=None
Data unique:-Python NumPy module has a built-in function named, numpy.unique to fetch unique data items from a numpy array.
Data type:-a data type (or simply type) is a collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of these values as machine types.
Data Merge:-pandas provides various methods for combining and comparing Series or DataFrame. concat(): Merge multiple Series or DataFrame objects along a shared index or column. 
Data Skewness:-dataframe.skew() function return unbiased skew over requested axis Normalized by N-1. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.
Data Correlation:- the correlation between two variables in Python, we can use the Numpy corrcoef() function.
Data outliers:-utliers exist in your dataset, Remove outliers using Python from your dataset, How to use different methods, including z-scores and interquartile ranges
Data fillna:-fillna() manages and let the user replace NaN values with some value
Data astype:-set or convert the data type of an existing data column in a dataset or a data frame. 
Data Boxplot:-Box plot is also called a Whisker plot which provides a summary of a set of data that includes minimum, first-quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum value. 
Data Mean,Mode,Median:-Mean, median, and mode are fundamental topics of statistics. You can easily calculate them in Python, with and without the use of external libraries.[Windows[1].json](https://github.com/Tanuja13894/project2.datawrangling/files/15169071/Windows.1.json)
